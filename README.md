Prototyped a  project to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately distinguishing between rocks and mines using sonar signals. This project involves collecting sonar data, preprocessing it to extract meaningful features, and training a classifier to predict whether a given sonar signal reflects off a rock or a mine. By using techniques such as feature extraction, model training, and evaluation, the project aims to create a reliable system that enhances underwater detection and navigation capabilities, potentially aiding in maritime safety and military operations.
